    "USGS Mission Areas are actually a somewhat elusive organizational construct despite their importance as the topmost organizing element in the USGS. They do have budgetary codes that fund the office function of the Mission Area, but they most often show up as a connecting reference via acronyms or other codes. To accommodate the connection, we introduce simple entities through a specialized API that provides basic nodes and relationships to the Associate Director in each case. Regions are similarly elusive and somewhat in flux over the last number of years with not all information systems and references fully meshing with the \"Interior Unified Regions.\""

    "Organizational units in USGS are challenging overall with no one master source and a number of different interpretations of the different types of units we have. One source that we do incorporate here comes from the idea of \"Cost Center,\" which is a budgetary term indicating where allocated funding flows in the organization. We use a slimmed down version of basic Cost Center information that is derived from an internal system and stripped down to its basics for graphing purposes. It includes a number of different kinds of \"centers,\" some of which are \"Science Centers\" and others that are \"Programs,\" along with relationships to \"Regions\" and \"Mission Areas\" and sub-organizations within larger Cost Centers. This does give us useful identifiers that we include as \"fbms_code\" properties that link people to organizational units from other sources."
