With the graph, we've essentially stitched together all of the functionally disconnected catalogs and inventories we have built up separately for our people and their skills, publications and datasets and the subject matters they address, and all the other pockets of information we have describing and containing our work. The process of building the graph exercises all of that, evaluating and making decisions about the relationships between things, harmonizing different content models, and putting everything together in a way that it can be queried as a whole.\n",

On the one hand, this can be just about everything we do across earth system science, but we need to narrow in on those assets that are most closely connected to the topic area. This notebook explores the start to that process via a full text query across nodes containing likely content where we can initiate a search. From this, we can pull together a sub-graph based on the connections developed here."
