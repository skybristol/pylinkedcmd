The other is part of a loosely managed collection of other narratives, and the data in that area is really messy. I made an attempt to clean things up somewhat, but it still needs more work and NER may yield better results from this content anyway. Because the more structured keywords are actually pretty reasonable and reasonably sized (882 distinct terms), I go ahead and add them to the graph here as UndefinedSubjectMatter entities with an ADDRESSES_SUBJECT relationship with projects. Some of these terms appear to be specialized codes being used by USGS Programs or Mission Areas, so they may be able to get some type of definition with a little more digging."

We then summarize the budget information to produce a simple data that gives us the personnel ID, project number and task number that we can use to identify a subset of the projects where we are able to make a \"FUNDED_BY\" relationship connection. The number of hours we are using is a fluid figure as this information is changing all the time as accounting is ongoing, but we determine the maximum between two different accounting numbers (planned and actual) and put that number into an \"hours\" property on the relationships."
